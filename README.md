**Hi there** 👋 I'm Benjamin.

I'm a full-stack web developer, with a focus on back-end development using PHP.

I'm the author of a few popular PHP libraries, such as [brick/math](https://github.com/brick/math) (a dependency of Laravel) and [brick/money](https://github.com/brick/money). I'm also the author of many *non*-popular libraries 😏

You'll find that whenever I start working on something that I feel may be reusable, I tend to make it an open-source library. Some of these libraries get more ❤️ than others, but I usually find time to maintain most of them.

I'm an occasional contributor to Doctrine ([ORM](https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3ABenMorel+repo%3Adoctrine%2Form+is%3Aclosed) & [DBAL](https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3ABenMorel+repo%3Adoctrine%2Fdbal+is%3Aclosed)).

I'm also an entrepreneur 👔, an amateur pianist 🎹 and a dad 👶.

**I'm currently looking for a new job/business opportunity**, so if you're working on something cool and need more (man|brain)power, I may be your guy. [Get in touch!](mailto:benjamin.morel@gmail.com)
