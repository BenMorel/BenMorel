**Hi there** 👋 I'm Benjamin.

I'm a full-stack web developer, with a focus on back-end PHP development.

I'm the author of a few popular PHP libraries, such as [brick/math](https://github.com/brick/math) (a dependency of Laravel and `ramsey/uuid`) and [brick/money](https://github.com/brick/money). I'm also the author of far more lesser-known libraries.

You'll find that whenever I start working on something that I feel may be reusable, I tend to make it an open-source library. Some of these libraries get more ❤️ than others, but I usually find time to maintain most of them.

I'm an occasional contributor to Doctrine ([ORM](https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3ABenMorel+repo%3Adoctrine%2Form+is%3Aclosed) & [DBAL](https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3ABenMorel+repo%3Adoctrine%2Fdbal+is%3Aclosed)).
